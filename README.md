# LT2212 V19 Assignment 2

From Asad Sayeed's statistical NLP course at the University of Gothenburg.

My name: Linnea Strand

## Additional instructions

Not quite ready yet, to say the least.
I used CountVectorizer, but if it turns that that was not allowed I will of course redo this thing.

## File naming convention

As for now:
file1:
term-document matrix with no vocabulary restriction and no other transformations
file2:
term-document matrix with a vocabulary restriction of 500 dims
file3:
term-document matrix with no vocabulary restriction, but with tf-idf applied
file4:
the same vocabulary restriction as in (2), but with tf-idf applied

## Results and discussion
This will have to wait until I have a result.

### Vocabulary restriction

### Result table

(Try to use the Markdown table format for this.)

### The hypothesis in your own words

### Discussion of trends in results in light of the hypothesis

## Bonus answers

(Delete if you're not answering the bonus.)
